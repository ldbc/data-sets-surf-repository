# LDBC datasets

Starting from 2026, the datasets for LDBC's active benchmarks are hosted on Cloudflare R2, see their links on the [Datasets page](https://ldbcouncil.org/resources/datasets/).

For historical datasets and as a mirror, you can use the old [SURF repositories](https://repository.surfsara.nl/community/cwi).
